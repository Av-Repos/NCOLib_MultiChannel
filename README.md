# Neural Combinatorial Optimization Library (NCOLib)

## Introduction
The Neural Combinatorial Optimization Library (NCOLib) is an accessible software library designed to simplify the application of neural network models and deep learning algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It brings the power of NCO closer to non-experts, including industry professionals and junior researchers.

## Requirements
- PyTorch

## TODO

- Include datasets to be used as an alternative to random generators.
- Add Non-Auto-regressive (heatmap) + search (subclass of Problem).
- Improve basic tour: add comments and convert to a .ipynb.
- Create advanced tour
- Add tests
- Add other GNN architectures: GNN with edges, GCN, GAT, etc.
- Add more problems: scheduling, assignment, etc.
- Add graph-context as the used in POMO decoder.
- Add memory-mechanism to env and model.
- Actor critic and PPO training.
- Add data augmentation (POMO).
