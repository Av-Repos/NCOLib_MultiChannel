# Neural Combinatorial Optimization Library (NCOLib)

## Introduction


## Requirements
- PyTorch

## TODO

- Include datasets to be used as an alternative to random generators.
- Add Non-Auto-regressive (heatmap) + search (subclass of Problem).
- Improve basic tour: add comments and convert to a .ipynb.
- Create advanced tour
- Add tests
- Add other GNN architectures: GNN with edges, GCN, GAT, etc.
- Add more problems: scheduling, assignment, etc.
- Add graph-context as the used in POMO decoder.
- Add memory-mechanism to env and model.
- Actor critic and PPO training.
- Add data augmentation (POMO).
